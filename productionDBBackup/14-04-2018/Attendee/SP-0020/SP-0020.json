But who really is this corporate veteran, and what has made him such a stalwart? He has been finance director of Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the Tata Group. He has also been chairman of Voltas, the consumer durables company of Tata that has delivered superlative shareholder returns over the past few years.He has played a key role in steering the fortunes of companies as diverse as Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Titan, as a senior director on their boards. He has helped nurture many strong alliances, in companies such as Tata Sky, Tata AIA Life Insurance and Tata AIG. He has been a voice for the group par excellence, having successfully handled difficult situations ranging from the Tata Finance episode nearly two decades ago, to the extraordinary general meetings of some Tata firms less than a year ago. Yet, as he retires from the Tata Group, he is best known to many not merely as a senior finance whiz, or as chairman of several successful companies, but as the wise man of Bombay House, the stately building in south Mumbai that serves as headquarters to Indiaâ€™s largest corporate group."},"lastName":{"type":"string","value":"Hussain"},"linkedInURL":{"type":"string","value":""},"profileImageURL":{"type":"string","value":""},"profileServices":{"0":{"type":"string","value":"Speaker"},"type":"array"},"timestamp":{"type":"date","value":"2018-04-10T13:52:08.702Z"}}
