{"briefInfo":{"type":"string","value":"Former MD & CEO, TCS"},"firstName":{"type":"string","value":"F C"},"fullName":{"type":"string","value":"F C Kohli"},"info":{"type":"string","value":"F.C. Kohli is universally regarded as the father of the Indian software industry. He carried the title of vice-chairman of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for years (Nani Palkhiwala was nominally chairman then). Kohli has been the architect and the driving force of TCS' phenomenal success. It is the first real Indian multinational, and led the way for every other software company to follow. It continues its leadership position and grows year on year in sales and profits without any surprises. Its blue-chip roster of Western clients makes it the envy of every other company, and it has a large domestic base too. However, the goal of TCS going public eluded Kohli till he stepped down as chairman in 2000. Kohli continues to be hyperactive, focussing his energies on education. His current brainchild is to use computer aided sounds and images to impart basic literacy, particularly to illiterate adults, in a matter of months."},"lastName":{"type":"string","value":"Kohli"},"linkedInURL":{"type":"string","value":""},"profileImageURL":{"type":"string","value":"http://www.tieconpune.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/F-c-kohli.jpg"},"profileServices":{"0":{"type":"string","value":"Speaker"},"type":"array"},"timestamp":{"type":"date","value":"2018-04-10T14:11:35.771Z"}}
